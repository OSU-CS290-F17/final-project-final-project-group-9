# CS 290 Final Project: Group 9
Members: John Davis, Rohan Varma, Prathyoosha Chaya

The purpose of this website is to provide existing workout routine samples to users, and allow for custom routine creation based on user-inputted criteria.

# Dependencies:
We used AngularJS, the Angular Router, and Bootstrap, however, when you run the program these need not be installed since they are already included.

# To Start:
Clone this into a local file, change directories into the folder, then run the command "npm start"
Navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser to access the site
